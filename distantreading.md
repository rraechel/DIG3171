# Summary

Based off the responses I received from CoPilot and the results from Voyant, I learned that these tools could help give a general idea of the information provided to them. My results from Voyant were underwhelming. I felt there was a lack of information provided, and it was hard to understand what the text I provided to Voyant consisted of, based off the results. When using CoPilot, I was able to get a better summary and understanding of what it was analyzing. It was able to provide information from the text that would have taken me longer to gather myself, such as when I asked what the five best shows were based off both critic and audience scores. This process has helped me learn it is necessary to fact check these tools for accuracy and they should not be relied on too heavily but are good for providing quick help or searching for information.
